# Project 4

ENGO 651-Lab4

The project mainly focuses on designing a map of Calgary Schools and Calgary Health Clinics and Hospitals. 

After running application.py, you can get a link "http://127.0.0.1:5000/". Pasting the link to your browser, you can get to a page where you can see a map of Calgary, you can either zoom in or zoom out to get a better view of the map. The mark with a ruler and a pencil stands for schools and the other mark stands for hospitals.

In the webpage, when you move your mouse to a mark, you can get a popup with the name and the address of the location.

When you click the mark of a school, you can see the mark of the nearset hospital will turn to purple and you can easily see the name and the address of the hospital through mouse moving.
